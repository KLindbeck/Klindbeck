üìñ Biography       

After graduating High school I worked for my local Boy Scouts of America as their Directory of Ecology specializing in environmental and nature related teachings.Where I got trained as a Leave No Trace Trainer and a Tread Lightly Trainer for prevention of environmental impact! I also enrolled in my local community college to major in Environmental Science with the goal to become an Ecologist for Major Companies and do to Ecological Impact Serves for potential building sites. After 2 semesters I switched majors to Cyber Security and System Administration, after realizing while I loved and still do love science and nature,I just enjoyed learning about computers slightly more.
